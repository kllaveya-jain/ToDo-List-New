# ToDo-List-New
A full stack ToDo List web app using MongoDB as the database (using mongoose) along with EJS templates (through HTML and CSS) for front-end and Node.js and Express.js for back-end.
It is an advancement over my previous project "ToDo-List". Link: https://github.com/kllaveya-jain/ToDo-List

This web app allows you to create as many different lists as you want. This can be very easily be done by just appending the list title you want at the end of the URL.
The root route redirects you to the default daily todo list of yours:

Every list has the above three items by default.
These lists use MongoDB database instances at the back-end and so once set up properly hold the items in your lists persistently even in case of temporary server failure or if you refresh your webpage due to network issues.
This project uses the capabilities of "lodash" to capitalise your list titles as you specify them through the URLs so you need not worry too much about the grammar in your URLs.
